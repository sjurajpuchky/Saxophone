Intro:
  Saxophone is simple stream xml parser with optional configuration support. You no need more than 1MB memory to process XML file.
  Is fast as possible and access interface is integrated into file stream support, that means you can access XML file from any where
  and process directly. Saxophone is licensed under GPLv3 any time you wish use in commercial application, kindly contact me and we will
  discuss commerce non exclusive developer license and conditions related with copyright rights.

How to use:
===========

At first you have to include Saxophone.php class file.

  $GLOBALS["xmlopt"] = array( 
     "encoding" => "utf-8", 
     "object" => "//*/SHOPITEM", 
     "type" => "XPATH",         // TAG,XPATH,TAGSLIST 
     "fields" => array( 
         "productName" => "//*/SHOPITEM/PRODUCT" 
     )  
 ); 
       
Specify encoding
================

 $fp = fopen("sax://xml;xprocess;xprocesstag;sample.xml;xmlopt","rb",true); 
 // Load fuel till end by 4096 bytes
 while(!feof($fp)) { fread($fp,4096);} 
 // Close fire
 fclose($fp); 
 // Mision completed we are on the orbit
